#Pull down the DNA from a list of gene names#

Small node server app. The idea is you pass it a list of gene names like:
1. slr
2. lacz
3. glp

and it will query the ncbi and download the dna sequences associated with these genes.

I currently am restricting it to bacterial sequences, because that happens to be what I am currently interested in.
